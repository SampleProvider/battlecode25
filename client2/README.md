# Battlecode Client ðŸŒ±
To run the client locally:
1. `npm i` to install dependencies
2. `npm i prettier` for formatting
3. `npm run fix-schema` to fix `TS2307: Cannot find module 'flatbuffers' or its corresponding type declarations.`
4. `npm run watch` to run the app.

Run `npx prettier [file].tsx --write` on any changed files to standardize the format.
